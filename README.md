# Unity_Aula3

For this first contact with Unity, we were instructed to create a scene with some basic assets, and then we learnt how to animate objects.

I thought it would be interesting to align the cloud group with the peak of the mountain, and then, create an animation by only rotating the entire group.
I also created a day cycle animation, rotating the light source and changing the color, from a orange-ish yellow to a dark red, and then to a gray.
